# Show me the Weather!

Sample App to display the weather using Yahoo weather API

## Requirements
- Rails application to show Yahoo weather information for 2 locations: Sydney and Melbourne.
- The user should be able to select the location of their choice (Sydney or Melbourne).
- After selecting the location, the user should be shown the forecast for the next few days.
- Application should use models that will best represent the data being shown.
- Each time the weather is checked, the results should be saved to the database. The user doesnâ€™t need to be shown the results of previous weather checks, but they should be stored for future features which may be added to the application. 

## Assumptions
- Only using Yahoo to get weather info, so only handling their style of data.
- Not sure if it's useful to save the weather details, so I just saved it as json (rather than normalised tables).  

## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install
```

Next, migrate the database and load the seed data:

```
$ rails db:migrate
$ rails db:seed
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```
$ rails test
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```
